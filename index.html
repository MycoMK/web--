            She was Ellen’s very first guest a whopping 17 years ago, and now she’s
            guest hosting on the hit show for her beloved ‘real-life friend.’
            Jennifer Aniston looked sublime as she guest-hosted for Ellen DeGeneres
            on her hit daytime show Friday, while Ellen claimed she had to go to the
            DMV. Aniston also reminded the audience that The Ellen DeGeneres Show is
            filmed on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, which just so happened to
            have been Aniston’s professional home when she was filming Friends from
            1994 to 2004 ‘She throws pennies away. She throws them right into the
            garbage, in front of people,’ Jen exclaimed, poking fun at Ellen’s
            staggering financial success. ‘Good luck pennies!’ Another big ‘reveal’
            came when Aniston said, ‘I can’t even walk into her dressing room
            because she’s burning one of those Gwyneth Paltrow candles!’ After a few
            more jokey secrets, the Cake star began reminiscing about the past and
            shared a true ‘secret,’ or rather, little-known fact about her and
            Ellen: ‘I was actually Ellen’s very first guest on this show!’ She was
            referring to her September 8, 2003 appearance on Ellen’s show, which
            indeed was the first-ever episode of the long-running, Emmy
            Award-winning talk show.
